      üçæ Welcome to the **mctrl-tools** project, a collection of tools that we use, and make it easier
      (we configured everything for you), faster (every binary is cached and uploaded to cachix), and
      more reliable.

      To run our tools:
        - you can use the `just` command.
        - you can install them in your system.
        - you can use the `nix develop` command.
        - you can use the `nix run` command.
        - you can use the `nix shell` command.

      ```sh-session
      just watch <args>
      ```
